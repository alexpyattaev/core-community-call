### Summary
Networking newsreel:
 * multihoming & port/socket binding in multi-interface world
 * XDP support coming to agave
 * Observability tools for validator network traffic

### Technical Overview
- Multihoming is coming our way, it will allow a validator to efficiently use multiple network interfaces (e.g. connected to different ISPs) for redundancy and/or latency optimization. Along with obvious reliability benefits, multihoming brings interesting new configuration challenges as well.
- Why and where are we switching to XDP and what it means for performance vs usability tradeoff in agave. 
- Tooling to watch how validator is using the network bandwidth
